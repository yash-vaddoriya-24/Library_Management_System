# 📚 Library Management System

## 🧐 Objective

The Library Management System is a simple Java-based application designed to manage a collection of books. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.

## ✅ Requirements

- Add Books 📖:

    - Users should be able to add new books to the library
    - Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and publication year.

- Borrow Books 📚:

    - Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
    - The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be borrowed.
    - If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.

- Return Books 🔄:

    - Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
    - System should update the availability of the book accordingly.

- View Available Books 👀:

    - Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

## ⚙️ Technology Used
This project is developed using the following technologies:
- Java: The main programming language for logic and functionality.
- JUnit: A testing framework used to ensure code reliability through unit tests.
- Maven/Gradle: For project build and dependency management
- Git: Version control for tracking changes and collaboration.

## 🚀 Getting Started 
📋 Prerequisites 
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher.
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
- JUnit for running tests.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/yash-vaddoriya-24/Library_Management_System.git  
    cd library_management_system 

## ▶️ Running the Application
As this is a code-only project, there is no user interface. To run the application, execute the main class (LibraryService) in your IDE or terminal.

## 🧪 Running Tests
To run the test suite:

- Execute test cases directly in your IDE. use Junit:
    ```bash
    Junit

## 🌟 Features Implemented

- Add Books: Adds a new book to the library's collection.
- Borrow Book: Allows users to borrow a book if it is available.
- return Books: Allows users to return a borrowed book.
- View Available Books: Lists all books that are currently available in the library.

## 💡 Additional Features
- Validation: The Book class ensures that all required parameters (ISBN, Title, Author, Year) are provided when creating a new book.
- Error Handling: Proper error handling for cases like borrowing a non-existent or unavailable book.
